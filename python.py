# This code calculates the absolute difference between the sum and difference of the squares of two numbers a and b.
# It first computes a1 as the sum of squares (a^2 + b^2) and a2 as the difference of squares (a^2 - b^2).
# Finally, it prints the absolute value of the difference between a1 and a2.
